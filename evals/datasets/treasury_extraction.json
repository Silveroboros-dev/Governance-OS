The main operating account at Chase has $32.1M, and our sweep account at Goldman has $13.1M.\n\nWe need to execute a wire transfer of $5M to our European subsidiary by January 15th for their Q1 operating expenses.\n\nAlso, I noticed our daily cash forecast is showing a potential shortfall of $2.3M in the third week of January due to the large vendor payments scheduled.\n\nPlease review and advise on our options.\n\nRegards,\nJohn",
