Currently, my equity allocation has drifted to 72% due to the recent market rally, but my target allocation is 60% equities, 30% fixed income, and 10% alternatives.\n\nI'm also concerned about concentration risk - my tech holdings (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) now represent 35% of my total portfolio.\n\nCould we schedule a call to discuss reducing my tech exposure and bringing everything back to target?\n\nThanks,\nJohn Smith\nAccount #WM-45892",
